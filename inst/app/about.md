<h3 style="color:#A6ACAF;">Purpose</h3>
<span style="color: #1B2631";">This Shiny app allows users to easily compare the condition of Covid-19 in 27 member countries of the European Union over time. It consists of 3 dimensions of exploration, from daily number to the overall trend, as well as relevant variables, e.g. life expectancy and case fatality rate. Hence, the aim of this app is to invite users to inspect to what extent have different EU countries been coping with Covid-19 till 5th October, 2020. Users who are only interested in certain EU countries are definitely welcomed to obtain Covid-19-related information, which also serves as a purpose for this app.</span>
